I have a c++20 struct that I need shared access to from multiple threads.  I want to mutex/lock the two methods put and get.  here is the struct:

namespace taskservice {
    struct Task {
        std::string task = "";
        std::  created;

        void add_task(std::string cmd) {

        }
    }
