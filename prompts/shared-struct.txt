The c++20 struct below contains a vector that I need shared access to from multiple threads.  I want to mutex/lock the two methods put and get.  Can you re-write this?

namespace taskservice {
    struct Task {
        std::string task = "";
        std::  created;
    }

    std::vector<Task> tasks = {};

    // now define the funcs
    Task put(std::string cmd) {
        auto now = now();
        Task t = Task{.task = cmd, .created = now}

        // lock first
        tasks.push_back(t);

        return t;
    }

    Task get() {
        // lock first
        Task t = tasks.back();

        return t;
    }
}
